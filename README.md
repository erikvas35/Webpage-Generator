# Webpage Generator

## Overview

**Webpage Generator** is a Java-based application that allows users to dynamically create HTML content by generating customizable HTML headers. The project provides an object-oriented approach to generating and combining different types of HTML header elements (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) using Java objects. Users can create, customize, and combine these header objects to automatically generate valid HTML code for use in their web pages.

This tool is perfect for anyone looking to automate the creation of HTML headers, streamline the webpage design process, or learn more about object-oriented programming with Java.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Header Generation**: Create various types of HTML header elements using Java objects, such as `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.
- **Customizable Headers**: Customize each header with text, styling (e.g., font-size, color), and other HTML attributes.
- **HTML Code Generation**: Automatically generate valid HTML code by combining multiple header objects, which can be used directly in a webpage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line or GUI interface (if implemented) to create and manage HTML headers.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Built using Java classes and objects, making it easy to extend and modify for different use cases.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: The primary programming language used to build the application.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes and objects are used to represent different HTML header elements and their properties.
- **HTML**: The output of the program is valid HTML code that can be used directly in webpages.

## How It Works

1. **Create Header Objects**: Users can create Java objects for various types of HTML headers (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.).
2. **Customize Each Header**: Each header object can be customized with text, font size, color, and other attributes.
3. **Generate HTML Code**: Once the headers are created and customized, the code combines them into valid HTML code.
4. **Combine Multiple Headers**: Users can combine multiple header objects in any order to generate more complex HTML structures.
